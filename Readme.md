Dynamic Programming is a method used to avoid redundant computations.
It is a problem-solving approach that breaks down a problem into overlapping subproblems, ensuring the same problem is not solved multiple times. Its purpose is to improve time complexity.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a benchmark comparison between brute force recursion and dynamic programming.
