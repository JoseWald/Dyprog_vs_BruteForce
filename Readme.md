Dynamic Programming is a method to avoid redundant computing.
There is 3 different ways to solve a dynamic programming problem
    1/Top-down:usefull if you like recursive call so you use a memoization to avoid every redundance
    2/Bottom-up:More efficient because there's no recursion
    3/Memory optimization: It's preferable if we face some memory issues
