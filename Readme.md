Dynamic Programming is a method to avoid redundant computing.
It's a type of problem solving which overlap the problem in sub problem and 
avoiding to resolve the same problem again.His purpose is to improve the time complexity.
In this repo ,  you gonna see the benchmark of brute force recursion vs dynamic programming.
